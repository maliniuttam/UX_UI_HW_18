                <h4> Government Redesign</h4>
                <p> This government redesign was to redesign the home page layout 
                    and UI to make it easier for the user to navigate the website. 
                    The original website was cluttered and a lot of the navigation 
                    did not align with headings.

                <h4> Allergy 101 App</h4>
                <p> This project was to create an app for users with food allergies that
                    helps them find quality places to eat in their area. We merged Yelp
                    and Find Me Gluten Free to make an easily accessible app that helps 
                    users with allergies.
